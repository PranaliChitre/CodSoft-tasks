TASK 1
Titanic Survival Rate Prediction Project Using Naive Bayes:
1. Dataset:
Use the Titanic dataset, which typically includes information such as passenger class, sex, age, number of siblings/spouses aboard (SibSp), number of parents/children aboard (Parch), fare, and survival status.
2. Data Preprocessing:
Handle missing values: Impute or drop missing values, especially for crucial features like age and fare.
Encode categorical variables: Convert categorical variables like 'Sex' into numerical values (e.g., male=0, female=1).
Feature selection: Choose relevant features that might influence survival.
3. Split Data:
Split the dataset into training and testing sets to evaluate the model's performance.
4. Naive Bayes Model:
Use the Gaussian Naive Bayes algorithm for this project, as it assumes that the features follow a Gaussian distribution.
Train the model using the training dataset.
5. Predictions:
Use the trained model to make predictions on the test set.
6. Model Evaluation:
Assess the model's performance using graphs
