TASK no. 1
Titanic Survival Rate Prediction Project Using Naive Bayes:
1. Dataset:
Use the Titanic dataset, which typically includes information such as passenger class, sex, age, number of siblings/spouses aboard (SibSp), number of parents/children aboard (Parch), fare, and survival status.
2. Data Preprocessing:
Handle missing values: Impute or drop missing values, especially for crucial features like age and fare.
Encode categorical variables: Convert categorical variables like 'Sex' into numerical values (e.g., male=0, female=1).
Feature selection: Choose relevant features that might influence survival.
3. Split Data:
Split the dataset into training and testing sets to evaluate the model's performance.
4. Naive Bayes Model:
Use the Gaussian Naive Bayes algorithm for this project, as it assumes that the features follow a Gaussian distribution.
Train the model using the training dataset.
5. Predictions:
Use the trained model to make predictions on the test set.
6. Model Evaluation:
Assess the model's performance using graphs


TASK no. 3
IRIS dataset project:
In this Python project using the Iris dataset, you employed pandas for data manipulation and visualization, numpy for numerical operations, and matplotlib for creating scatter plots to visualize the relationships between sepal and petal dimensions for each species. After encoding the categorical target variable with LabelEncoder, you split the dataset into training and testing sets. Utilizing the Support Vector Machine (SVM) algorithm from scikit-learn, you trained a classification model and evaluated its performance on the test set, achieving accuracy using `model.score`, and further analyzing results with a confusion matrix and classification report. The project concludes with a heatmap visualization of the confusion matrix, providing a comprehensive overview of the model's predictive capabilities.

Task-5
Credit card fraud detection
This model on building and evaluating a logistic regression model for credit card fraud detection using the scikit-learn library. The dataset, loaded from a CSV file named "creditcard.csv," contains information about credit card transactions, including a binary "Class" column indicating whether a transaction is normal (Class 0) or fraudulent (Class 1).

The initial exploration of the dataset involves examining its structure, statistical summary, and checking for missing values. The data is then split into two subsets: legitimate transactions (Class 0) and fraudulent transactions (Class 1). Descriptive statistics, such as mean and count, are computed separately for both classes to gain insights into the characteristics of each.

To address the class imbalance issue, under-sampling is performed on the legitimate transactions to create a balanced dataset for training. The Logistic Regression model is chosen for its simplicity and interpretability. The dataset is divided into training and testing sets using the `train_test_split` function.

The logistic regression model is trained on the training set, and its accuracy is evaluated on both the training and testing sets. Additionally, classification metrics such as precision, recall, and F1-score are computed using the `classification_report` function. A confusion matrix and a heatmap visualization of the confusion matrix are also generated using `confusion_matrix` and the seaborn library, respectively.

The confusion matrix and heatmap provide a clear representation of the model's performance in terms of true positives, true negatives, false positives, and false negatives. This information is crucial for assessing the effectiveness of the logistic regression model in detecting fraudulent credit card transactions. The code offers a comprehensive approach to building and evaluating a fraud detection model using logistic regression and visualizing its performance metrics.
